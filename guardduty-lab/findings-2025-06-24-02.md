## Description  
The API ListRolePolicies was invoked using root credentials from IP address 68.36.171.72. Troy United States. Guard duty triggered the alert since root credentials were used. This could pose a threat if the activity was unauthorized.


## Implications  
Use of root credentials for API calls is generally discouraged as it carries high privilege. Although this finding is low severity, it indicates potential risk of misuse or compromise of root credentials, which could lead to unauthorized access or privilege escalation.

## Recommended Response  
1. Verify if this API call was initiated by an authorized administrator.  
2. Rotate root account access keys immediately if the activity is suspicious or unauthorized.  
3. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) on the root account to reduce risk.  
4. Monitor further root credential usage and consider restricting root API access via IAM policies.  

## Status  
Open
