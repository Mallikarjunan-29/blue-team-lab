# ‚öôÔ∏è AWS CLI Lab ‚Äì Verifying Blue-Lab-User Access

## üéØ Objective

Use the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) to authenticate with `blue-lab-user`, validate permissions, and prepare for detection-based workflows.

---
## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Pre-requisites

AWS Free Tier account
IAM user (blue-lab-user) with ReadOnlyAccess
Access keys generated and saved securely
AWS CLI installed

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure AWS CLI

Run the following command:

```bash
aws configure
```
Enter the details from the access key created earlier:
AWS Access Key ID
AWS Secret Access Key
Region: us-east-2 (or your preferred region)
Output format: json
![Config Inputs](../images/aws-cli-configure.png)
*Screenshot: Inputs presented to the aws config command*

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Validate Access

Run the following command

```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
```
Expected Output:
ARN of the IAM user
Account ID
User ID

![Caller Identity](../images/aws-cli-caller-identity.png)
*Screenshot: Validated access related information*

‚úÖ Outcome
blue-lab-user is now configured locally with CLI access. This user will be used to safely interact with AWS services like:
GuardDuty alerts
CloudTrail logs
VPC Flow Logs
IAM policy evaluation
S3 bucket visibility

üîí Notes
CLI access uses programmatic credentials, not your root account ‚Äî best practice ‚úÖ
Keep .aws/credentials file secured (stored in your home directory)
No destructive actions can be taken due to ReadOnly permissions
